<center><span style="font-size: 28px; font-face: bold; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px;">What is Corionis Service Manager?</span></center>
<hr/>
The Corionis Service Manager (CSM) is a small Windows tray application that 
monitors and manages a list of user-selected Windows services. The selected 
services are monitored and may be started, stopped, the start-up 
type changed, etc.

Most people who regularly monitor and manage Windows services are only 
interested in a few. Because CSM is a Windows tray app it is always 
available. The utility may be popped up or down by double-clicking the 
tray icon. Notifications are displayed and logged when a 
selected service's state changes.
