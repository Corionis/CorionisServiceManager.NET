Added a Minify button for the Monitor tab to hide the menu and tabs; fixed a Select tab scroll
bug; added saving column order and position; various minor fixes. Also changed the installer
so the CSM configuration file may be kept between upgrades. Note: This first upgrade will delete
your existing configuration so your services will need to be selected again.
