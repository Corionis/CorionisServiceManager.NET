# History

This implementation of the Corionis Service Manager is a complete re-write of
the [original CSM](https://corionis.github.io/CorionisServiceManager/) that 
was first released in 2017.

That implementation was done using the AutoIt tool. This version is written 
with Microsoft C# and .NET and is a more robust implementation.
